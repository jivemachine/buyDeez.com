# frontend + backend project

This is a sample mock-ecommerce store I'm building using Angular 10 as frontend and Django for the backend.

- i'm following a few different youtube tutorials to build this project. I've been working in ecommerce for awhile and I want to develop my scope of how front end and backend products connect together by developing a site from scratch.
